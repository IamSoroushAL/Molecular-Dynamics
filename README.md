Molecular dynamics is a simulation for analyzing the physical movements of molecules.
The intermolecular potential used for this simulation is Lennard-Jones potential.
This project simulate molecules movements in 2 dimentions.


# Prerequisites
The only requirement for running the python code is matplotlib and it can be install using:
